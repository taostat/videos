What are alpha tokens, how are they used, and should I purchase them?

Alpha
------------------------
Each subnet has it's own unique token internal to bittensor, called the subnet's "alpha" token.  Each subnet's alpha token has a price in TAO that is determined by the market.
You'll receive dividends in alpha according to how much alpha you hold.  So you can think of alpha as shares in a subnet, you can also think of alpha as staked tokens for a subnet.

Remember before dTAO, participants got paid for their contributions in TAO.  Now that each subnet has its own alpha token, miners, validators, subnet owners and stakers are now paid in alpha for each subnet they're operating in.  Alpha tokens can then be exchanged for TAO for participants that want to cash out or pay their costs in fiat.

Subnets are numbered, for example, I might say that I have stake in subnet 19, 64, and 245.  However some subnets will choose to use to use their subnet's associated greek letter [and then what? MORE ELABORATION REQUIRED HERE].  For example I might say that I own [...]

Tokenomics
------------------------
Just like TAO, each subnet's alpha tokens have a limited supply of 21m.  Since you must buy TAO in order to purchase alpha with it, the market cap of all the subnets put together will approximate TAO's market cap.  There will be a separate video for emissions.
[Might want to elaborate with 1 more sentence here? doug, thoughts?]


How to get alpha
-------------------------
Alpha for a subnet is purchased via it's subnet pool.  Subnet pools are essentially a decentralized exchange where TAO is the base token used for purchasing alpha.  See the separate video for more information on how subnet pools work.  You will be able to purchase alpha easily via taostats.io [OR WHATEVER THE SPECIFIC WEBSITE URL IS].


How its used
-------------------------
There are only 2 states or places where alpha exists:

1. In a subnet pool
or
2. In a wallet, staked to a validator

Alpha cannot be in a state where it's in a wallet and not staked to a validator.  When you go to purchase alpha, you'll be prompted to choose:

1. Which subnet.
2. How much alpha.
3. Which validator to stake your alpha with.


Actions you can take
---------------------------
While alpha is in your wallet, staked to a validator, you will receive dividends in that alpha token.  See another video for how emissions breakdown.

By default: you can only do 2 things with your alpha:
* It can be traded for TAO at the current market rate via a subnet pool.
* It can be staked to a different validator.  Currently, changing validators doesn't do anything directly for stakers.  However, it increases that validator's emissions- so pick a validator that you think is beneficial for the subnet and you'll indirectly increase the quality of the subnet and therefore your investment.  Taostats strives to be active on all subnets [or some other non-exhausting tiny taostats plug]

You cannot trade alpha, you cannot do anything other than the 2 operations above with alpha.

So there's only 1 way to buy or sell alpha for a subnet - you must go through it's subnet pool.  You can only exchange TAO for alpha or alpha for TAO.

What we've explained here is true of the native substrate bittensor blockchain, but may be expanded upon from EVM.  It's possible that we might see wrapped subnet tokens or other fancy products with EVM.


Risk
-----------------
Owning alpha comes with 2 layers of risk.

1. When the price of TAO goes down, the price of your subnet's alpha token also goes down (in USD).
2. If your subnet performs poorly it's alpha price will go down, and therefore your investment in it.

So investors that hold alpha are saying 2 things: they believe in bittensor AND they believe in a bittensor subnet.  If you aren't convinced about either bittensor's value or the subnet's value, it's probably best to do more research or stay away from alpha tokens.

Alpha investors engage in high risk high reward trading, they strongly contribute to the bittensor network by helping sus out the subnets that provide the most value to bittensor and TAO.  If you aren't looking for that increased risk but understand bittensor, you can simply hold and stake TAO on subnet 0 for lower risk.  Alpha stakers allow stakers to increase their rewards by positively contributing to the network- a revolutionary way to allow stakers to contribute to the bittensor network.

Network Benefits
----------------
By purchasing alpha in a subnet, you're showing support for that subnet, but you're also slightly increasing the value of that subnet's alpha token.

Since miners, validators, subnet owners, and stakers are all paid in alpha tokens, when you buy an alpha token in a subnet and cause the alpha token's price to increase, you're directly causing that subnet's participants to be paid more.  Thereby encouraging their work and signalling to the bittensor market that you think this subnet is more valuable.

Bittensor is a decentralized commodity marketplace and alpha is the price of each commodity.
