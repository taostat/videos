Alpha
------------------------
In dTAO (also known as RAO or dynamic TAO), each subnet will have it's own unique token internal to bittensor, called the subnet's "alpha" token.

Remember before dTAO, miners, validators, subnet owners, and stakers get paid for their contributions in TAO.  In dTAO, each subnet has its own internal token, its "alpha" token.  Instead of miners, validators, subnet owners and stakers getting paid in TAO, they're now paid in alpha for each subnet they're operating in.  You can think of alpha as shares in a subnet.

Just a point of clarification on the term "alpha", it has 2 meanings:
1. We refer generally to each subnet's token as it's alpha token.
2. The first subnet's token is called alpha, so you could say that the alpha subnet's alpha token is alpha...

There are only 2 states or places that alpha can be:

1. In a subnet pool
2. In a wallet, staked to a validator

While alpha is in your wallet, staked to a validator, you will receive dividends in that alpha token.

You can only do 2 things with your alpha:
* It can be staked to a different validator.  Currently, changing validators doesn't do anything directly for stakers.  However, it increase that validator's emissions- so pick a validator that you think is beneficial for the subnet and you'll indirectly increase the quality of the subnet and therefore your investment. [taostats plug here lol]
* It can be traded for TAO at the current market rate via a subnet pool.

You cannot trade alpha, you cannot do anything other than the 2 operations above with alpha.

So there's only 1 way to buy or sell alpha for a subnet - you must go through it's subnet pool.  You can only exchange TAO for alpha or alpha for TAO.
