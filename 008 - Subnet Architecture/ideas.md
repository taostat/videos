You can think of bittensor subnets as a decentralized business.

Each subnet has many participants that work to produce a product.
Every subnet runs a self-contained open-source codebase ontop of the bittensor code.

Subnet owners provide validator code to validators.
Subnet owners also provide default miner code that miners are encouraged and incentivized to improve upon.

Participants

remember miners do the work
validators check the work and grant access to the products
subnet owners control the work
stakers judge the value of the work

Distribution curve?

Competition

Miners are ranked by validators and given an incentive score. Miners with higher incentive values receive higher emissions.

Participants must pay to register - a fee determined by the subnet owner.  Recycling?
256 participation slots, 64 reserved for validators, the rest of the slots are for miners.  Miners can also use unused validator slots.

Miners have incentive
Validators have emissions
(actually show these values in the anim)

The root subnet is an exception and I'll do another video about it.
