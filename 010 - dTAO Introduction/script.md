What is dTAO?

dTAO or dynamic TAO sometimes also referred to as RAO, is the second major upgrade to the bittensor network.  The first major upgrade was subnets- permissionlessly allowing anyone to create their own subnet (or commodity) on bittensor.  We've seen massive network growth since the subnets upgrade.

This second major upgrade decentralizes emission allocation.

Remember,
miners do the work
validators check and grant access to the work
subnet owners control the work
and stakers judge the value of the work

Currently, top validators vote to determine subnet emissions.  Their vote is weighted based on how much TAO is staked to them (their own tao, plus tao from stakers).  Sort of like a representative democracy.

This has worked well as top validators have a large investment in the network and want to see their investment grow.  However, there are 2 major issues to fix:

1. As the network has grown, validators have a very difficult time valuing subnets, as there are many aspects to consider [visually scrolling text of the considerations- codebase, performance, growth, roadmap, product, profitability, decentralization, developer team, developer activity, TAM].

2. As the cost of registering subnets increased, validators helped fund subnet registerations and also became subnet owners.  Both of these roles makes validator's subnet emissions vote biased in favour of their own subnets.

As a result, for subnet owners, cultivating relationships with top validators was sometimes seen as more important than value and quality.

-------------------------------

Dynamic Tao was conceived as a solution to these problems

dTAO decentralizes the power to allocate emissions to all network participants, allowing all participants to have an active say in the direction of the network.  Essentially moving the network from a representative democracy to a direct democracy.

Instead of having large validators decide subnet emissions, stakers now directly vote on subnet emissions

Each subnet has it's own token internal to bittensor called the subnet's alpha token.  Instead of staking rewards being distributed in TAO, stakers will receive alpha tokens based on the subnets they support.  Alpha tokens have value relative to TAO, and can be traded for TAO.  The value of those tokens is based on stakers- based on market forces.  This means that stakers have the potential for increased returns if the subnets they choose increases in value.  Stakers also have potential for losses if they choose poor subnets.

There is still a safe staking option called root staking where you can stake to a validator on subnet 0 and receive a 'no-risk' APR, but as the usage of alpha increases over time, this safe staking reward will reduce proportionally.  Root staking will remain safe, but it's APR will continually decrease.

We will cover the details of how users delegate stake to validators and subnets in another video, but what is important to understand is that the emissions and value of each subnet will be determined by the demand for its alpha token (pegged against the base asset of $tao).

We will also go into more detail in a separate video on how the liquidity pools for alpha work and will evolve over time, but the main takeaways from this for holders of tao are:

- when dTao goes live you DO NOT have to do anything, you tao will stay staked, we call this root staking.  You will continue to receive dividends in $tao.
- over time if you do nothing, the amount of dividends you receive will start to decrease.
- over time you are incentivised to start to swap some of your staked tao for alpha tokens in subnets you believe show signs of growth/value and in return accumulate that alpha token in place of tao.  You'll be speculating that your alpha tokens will increase in value against $tao, thus making you a greater sum of $tao than had you done nothing.
- easy to use tools will be deployed with dTao to allow you to perform these actions
- initial launch will likely see a lot of early volatility and inexperienced users are advised not to deploy funds into alpha before they understand the mechanisms
- Education is key in terms of subnet value and how to interact and profit from the network

At Taostats, we are committed to making this evolution as informative and easy as possible as we step into this next phase of network growth.

Dynamic TAO stimulates network growth, allowing for an infinite expansion of subnets, lowering barriers to entry, and allows for evolutions in subnet design and revenue models.

We are very excited and looking forward to the future together.
