* in dtao, each subnet will have its own token (alpha, beta, gamma, ...) . Emissions in each subnet will no longer be in tao, but paid in the token of that subnet. For simplicity, we refer to subnet tokens generically as alpha.
* The only way to buy alpha tokens is through tao. The only way to sell alpha tokens is to buy tao.
* Purchase and sale of alpha and tao is through the use of liquidity pools.
* Bittensor terms are tao_in and alpha_in (the amounts of tao/ alpha in the LP)
* The “value” of alpha is tao_in/alpha_in
* Buying alpha - add tao to LP.. receive alpha_out staked to a validator.
* Alpha_in + tao_in =k there is a constant that the two sides of the pool must add up to.
* Every block: tao emission is added to tao_in (or alpha emission is added to alpha in)
* This changes k buy however much is added in….
* IDK if we bring in slippage?
    ** Slippage - if you buy alpha with tao, you get alpha based on the new exchange rate with your added tao in the pool.s o you always get a little bit less than you expected.
