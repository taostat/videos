WORK IN PROGRESS
For the end-users, the difference between which accounts they use to sign Substrate transactions or Ethereum transactions will depend on the type of wallet they use. For example, users signing with MetaMask will only be able to sign Ethereum-compatible network transactions while users using Polkadot-js wallet will only be able to sign Substrate-based transactions.


MM can only access EVM sandbox
EVM explorer cannot see substrate side transactions.
is mapped native like a proxy?  symlink?
