We're going to go over how to actually buy alpha tokens in bittensor.

We're going to use the taostats delegate app to do this, link in description.

First we'll need to connect our wallet to the site, then we'll be presented with this page.

You can see the TAO in your wallet here, to add a subnet's stake you simply click "add subnet" and you're presented with a table with all the subnets to pick from.

You have the subnet number, the market cap in TAO, liquidity in the pool in TAO - remember the higher the liquidity, the less in slippage you'll be paying,  And the volume in TAO.

If you want, you can pick your validator, and then click "add".

Clicking "add" simply adds another row to the delegate app.  Each row you've added allows you to stake into that subnet.


Adding to staking portfolio
--------------------
[not sure how do to this as the app isn't working right now]
[need to add a note about where to set the total you want to use for your staking portfolio]

Example 1
--------------------
Lets pretend that I like subnets 7, 19, 64.  This is not an endorsement of these subnets it's just an example.

So I'll go through the list and add these 3 subnets.

Lets pretend I really like subnet 64, and subnets 7 and 19 I like equally, but a little less than subnet 64.

So I'll pull the slider for subnet 64 up to 50%.  You can see that the other subnets' percentages have gone down to account for this.  These percentages represents the percentage of the entirety of my staking portfolio, in my case 50% of my 1 TAO staking portfolio.

You'll notice the slippage appears here, and you can manually change the max slippage you're willing to pay up here.  0.5% is the default.

Then I can hit delegate, approve and we've now got xyz [need to improve wording, once the app is more finished]


Example 2
--------------------
Now that I have stake, maybe I've decided that I like subnet 7 a bit more than subnet 19, how do I move stake from 7 to 19?  Well I can move the subnet 7 slider up, and it'll allocate more to my subnet 7 position, but I don't want to take away from my subnet 64 position.

To take alpha from my subnet 19 position and put it into subnet 7, I can hit this lock button on subnet 64.  Now my subnet 64 portion is fixed and I can move my position between the remaining subnets thereby allowing me to directly put stake from 19 into 7.

This interface allows me to view my portfolio at a glance and easily move stake between subnets.
